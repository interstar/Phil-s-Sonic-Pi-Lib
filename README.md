# Phil's Sonic Pi Lib
My library of useful functions when writing Sonic Pi tunes.

## Quick Start 
You'll need to copy phillib.rb entirely into a spare tab in the Sonic Pi editor. 

Run / "play" it (no sound comes out) to define the functions etc.

Now write your tune in another tab, calling the functions as appropriate.
